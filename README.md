# MATLAB Numerical Methods

A collection of MATLAB implementations for common numerical methods.

## Methods Included

### 1. Root Finding
- **Newton-Raphson Method** (`newtonRaphson.m`)
  - Finds roots of equations using the Newton-Raphson iterative method
  - Example: Solving `x^3 - x - 2 = 0`

### 2. Interpolation
- **Lagrange Interpolation** (`lagrange.m`)
  - Polynomial interpolation using Lagrange polynomials
  - Example with 7 data points

### 3. Curve Fitting
- **Least Squares Linear Regression** 
  - Option I (`leastSquaresOptionI.m`): Direct formula implementation
  - Option II (`leastSquaresOptionII.m`): Matrix form solution
  - Example with sample data points

## Usage

Each MATLAB script can be run independently. Simply execute any `.m` file in MATLAB to see the method in action with the provided example data.
